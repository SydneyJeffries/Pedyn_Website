          <p>
          The P2000 MRP software and manufacturing operations program will manage all engineering and manufacturing operations, from the point of sale to shipment of products. 
          The program allows you to define and manage all company part numbers, products, and materials. 
          The program also includes engineering management, and document control tools for configuration control.  
          Even though each module is integrated with the next, it is not mandatory to use all of the features of the program.
           In other words you may choose to use specific modules as stand-alone tools. 
           The way that you fit these program tools into your business is totally up to you.

          <p>
            The program layout makes it extremely easy to  navigate through the program forms. The Main Switchboard is a launching pad that opens top level program forms. Each top level form contains drill down navigation buttons that take the user to the next level of record detail, related forms or sub-form. The lower level forms have navigation buttons that allow the user to navigate back one step at a time, or to go directly to the main switchboard. This layout puts related information one or two clicks away. The color coded display helps the user to navigate between open forms with a single glance.

There is a navigation filter on the main screen that makes item filtering and grouping quick and easy. The form also provides quick navigation to item notes, bill of materials, and where used information. There is a hyperlink that allows direct online access to any component drawing or data sheet, provided that the appropriate drawing viewers are installed.

            From the Inventory Log you will find several Manufacturing and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Reports. These reports provide the user with valuable material requirement information. The reports compare work-order requirements to current stock positions, work in progress, and parts on order. The reports also detail material shortages and new purchase requirements.

All signatures for request, approval, ordering and receiving are made directly to the online form, and are password protected.

The Work Order Forms consist of a summary page and detail form. The work order items can be built to stock or built to order.  Sales order items can be selected directly from an active order list. The information required to open the work order is automatically inserted. The details can be manually adjusted if desired. If the Documentation for a given order item is not complete or if an engineering change notice is active for the work order item, visual warnings will appear on the screen to indicate all issues that must be resolved. The stock is checked for all required components and low quantities will be clearly evident. Once an item has been built it will automatically be added to finished goods inventory and the used components will be back-flushed from stock when the work order is closed. Note that active work orders drive material allocations and requirements.

          <p>
            The most crucial  process at any company  would undoubtedly be order entry. It is critical that all customer requests are recorded  accurately and completely. The Sales Order Form is setup to be straightforward and easy to use.
               </p>
<p>
  Just select the customer from the auto-dropdown  combo box, and all address information is automatically entered. If the order is from a new customer or the customer address information needs to be updated, a simple click on the customer detail button will open a detailed customer form.  Other combo boxes are used to select such things as salesman, shipping information, and market details.
</p>
<p>
Ordered items are selected from a dropdown combo box that is linked to the company item master and  product query. Selecting an item from the list will automatically provide, descriptions, list price, and company stock information. Order entry personnel simply fill out the quantity ordered, and sales price for each item sold. There is also a note window for each item that can be used when more specific order information is required.

</p>

<p>
We know that company order enter requirements are very specific. It is understood that no standard order entry form would meet all the requirements of any company. The Order Entry form however, can be easily modified, as well as all of the P2000 program forms, to meet the specific needs of your company.

This form allows the engineering department to clearly define and document changes made to all controlled documents,
from component and assembly drawings to bills of materials. The ECN form is linked to the Item Master allowing quick entry to any company component or drawing.
When an item is entered onto the ECN form, the description, revision  as well as component stock information is automatically displayed.
 Effectivity details and notes can also be entered for each item on the ECN form. The ECN has a password protected  approvals column for department signatures along with signature controls for drafting, checker, and final implementation verification.  An active status control is displayed at the top of the form and is automatically updated at each process stage until final implementation has been verified.
               </p>
<p>
  The <abbr title="egnieering change order" >ECO</abbr> provides a well documented history of all changes made to company drawings.

            The Engineering Support Form is an important  tool that provides employees with a way to make requests for engineering support, such as part number assignments, new BOMs, and drawing corrections.
            Using this tool to request support from engineering means that the request will be permanently documented and it will be promptly reviewed and responded to. The support form is linked to the company item master making it easy to reference any company part number or drawing.
            The form provides a detailed request status, priority, and indicates the initials of the engineer assigned to the request.
            The real time status on the Engineering Support Form allows any employee making a request the ability to monitor the support request progress.

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Engineering Support Form is not intended to set or direct engineering priorities or to initiate projects. It is simply a way for company associates to communicate critical day-to-day design and operation issues to the engineering department.

The Drafting Management Form is a very important document control tool. Draftsmen should work exclusively from this form. The tasks and priorities are set by the documentation manager,
and the draftsmen use the interactive status control to communicate the status of their progress back to the manager.
 The form also provides communication to the engineers responsible for a drafting project so that they may provide support and respond to request from drafting when it is time to review or sign-off a drawing.
 The drafting form is linked to the Controlled Drawing Form and to the <ABBR TITLE="ENGINEERING CHANGE NOTICE"> ECN </ABBR> Form. The task may be triggered by the approval of an engineering change notice.
 The form captures draftsmen workload, response time, and makes drafting priorities clear to all that have a need to know.
